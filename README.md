üî• This codebase is a demo version used to generate responded talking speeches or videos with multimodal large language model.

## Reproduce Steps

### üõ†Ô∏è 1. Installation:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Environment for different third-parties codebases pls refer to their official website: 

[Ola-Omni](https://github.com/Ola-Omni/Ola) as MLLM for response (can be replaced into any LLM)

[DICE-Talk](https://github.com/toto222/DICE-Talk) for talking-head generation

[OpenVoice](https://github.com/myshell-ai/OpenVoice/blob/main/docs/USAGE.md#openvoice-v2) for text-to-speech generation

[MeloTTS](https://github.com/myshell-ai/MeloTTS) provided as Base Speakers for tts

Our codebase builds upon above codebases. We extend our gratitude to their open-source models and excellent works, which have enabled us to further our exploration. 

### üöÄ 2. Demo Inference:

Output both tts speech and talking-head videos:

```bash
sh infer_all.sh
```

Output both tts speech only:

```bash
sh infer_tts_openvoice.sh
```
